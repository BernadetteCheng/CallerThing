## An elegant solution and prevention aid to phone fraud, encouraging vigilance

### Inspiration/Problem:
More and more fraudulent phone call scam methodologies are quickly emerging. There were certain approaches scammers are taking that are near impossible to detect prior to being already scammed. We wanted to create an easy-to-use application that would screen incoming numbers; lowering the risk of falling for these scams without needing to sacrifice taking calls from real numbers.

### What Does It Do:
whodis application runs in the background and when an incoming call is detected, the app dispatches an overlaying notification that alerts the user about additional information about the incoming number so that a stronger decision can be made about whether or not to take a call.
In addition to allowing the user to make better guesses to allow for a reduction of risk, whodis eliminates worry about missing calls. Being an elegant solution that is both proactive and preventative, whodis provides a positive-sum privacy experience.

### How It was Built:
  - Android Studio
  - Ekata
  - java
  - Love
